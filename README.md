# Sales Data Analysis
Real-world data science task completed using Python

## Information
In this repo, I use Python to analyze the answer business questions about 12 months of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.  

## Tasks
We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN and duplicated rows from DataFrame
- Removing rows with wrong values
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
- Rename columns for easier work
- Adding new columns for analyzing

Once I have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. To know more about my methods, read my kernel.
